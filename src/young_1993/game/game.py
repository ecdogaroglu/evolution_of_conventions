    history of play (state).

    Methodology:
    As players only observe a random portion of opponent's play history, the overall probability will be the average over all possible samples.
    First all possible opponent play samples of size k are computed from the given play history of size m.
    Then for ease of computation, possible samplings are reduced to their types and counts of occurences.
    For each possible opponent sample type, best responses are computed and whether the given strategy is among them is stored in a list.
    (Tie breaking is set to false to access the set of all best responses to a given sample.)
    Overall best response probability is then calculated by weighted averaging over the occurence of each opponent sample type.

    Args:
        state (numpy.ndarray): Two dimensional array representing an element of state space.
        strategy (int): The pure strategy (action) index for which the best response probability will be computed.
        k (int): The sample size according to which play histories are sampled.
        num_act (int): Number of actions in the game. Different number of actions for each player is not supported.
        payoffs (numpy.ndarray): The payoff matrix of the game with dimensions num_act x num_act x num_players. Only num_players = 2 is supported.

    Returns:
        float: The overall best response probability of the given pure strategy to the given state (history) of play.
                Must be in the interval [0,1].
